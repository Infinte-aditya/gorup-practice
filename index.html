    i have created two files index.html and styles.css 
    now we will only use these two to create a group portfolio page
    there should be a home, about, contact us and projects page

    this will include pictures, information and the projects that we create together 
    it is a very good to get familiar with collaborating on projects 
    so lets start doing it

    whoever sees this first can delete it and start the creation
